# Task Reward Generator

## Vision

The **Task Reward Generator** smart contract enables the creation and management of milestone-based reward systems on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for the definition of milestones with specific rewards, the funding of a reward pool, and the claiming of rewards by users upon completing milestones. This contract is useful for applications that involve performance-based incentives, reward programs, or achievement tracking.

## Features

- **Milestone Creation**: The contract owner can add new milestones with a description and a reward amount.
- **Reward Pool Funding**: The owner can fund the reward pool with Ether to ensure that rewards can be claimed.
- **Reward Claiming**: Users can claim rewards for specific milestones if the milestone has not been claimed and if sufficient funds are available in the reward pool.
- **Reward Pool Balance**: Users and the owner can view the current balance of the reward pool.
- **Milestone Details**: Users and the owner can retrieve details about specific milestones.

## Deployment Details

### Prerequisites

- **Solidity Compiler**: Solidity version `^0.8.0`.
- **Ethereum Wallet**: An Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for deploying the contract.
- **Development Environment**: Use Remix IDE or Truffle Suite for deployment.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Compile the Contract**:
   - **Using Remix IDE**:
     1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org).
     2. Create a new file and paste the contract code.
     3. Select the Solidity compiler version `^0.8.0` and compile the contract.

   - **Using Truffle Suite**:
     1. Place the contract in the `contracts` directory of your Truffle project.
     2. Configure Truffle with the correct Solidity compiler version in `truffle-config.js`.
     3. Run `truffle compile` to compile the contract.

2. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - **Using Remix IDE**:
     1. Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
     2. Select `TaskRewardGenerator` and deploy it using your Ethereum wallet.

   - **Using Truffle Suite**:
     1. Create a migration script in the `migrations` directory, e.g., `2_deploy_contracts.js`:

        ```javascript
        const TaskRewardGenerator = artifacts.require("TaskRewardGenerator");

        module.exports = function (deployer) {
          deployer.deploy(TaskRewardGenerator);
        };
        ```

     2. Run `truffle migrate` to deploy the contract to the Ethereum network.

3. **Interact with the Contract**:
   - **Fund the Reward Pool**: Use the `fundRewardPool` function to add Ether to the reward pool.
   - **Add Milestones**: Call the `addMilestone` function to create new milestones.
   - **Claim Rewards**: Use the `claimReward` function to claim rewards for specific milestones.
   - **Check Reward Pool Balance**: Use the `getRewardPoolBalance` function to view the current balance.
   - **Get Milestone Details**: Use the `getMilestone` function to retrieve details about a specific milestone.

### Example Usage

```javascript
// Example of interacting with the contract using web3.js

const contractAddress = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";
const contractABI = [ /* ABI array */ ];
const web3 = new Web3(Web3.givenProvider || "http://localhost:8545");
const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(contractABI, contractAddress);

// Example: Add a milestone
contract.methods.addMilestone("Complete Task A", web3.utils.toWei("1", "ether")).send({ from: ownerAddress });

// Example: Fund reward pool
web3.eth.sendTransaction({ from: ownerAddress, to: contractAddress, value: web3.utils.toWei("5", "ether") });

// Example: Claim a reward
contract.methods.claimReward(0).send({ from: userAddress });
```
